            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The first highlight about Lesson 3 is that VCSs or Version Control Systems are absolutely necessary. I didn't understand this before studying this lesson.
            VCS are organized and a great tool for collaboration. Instead of saving several different versions of folders, naming them by specific guidelines, and posting to some kind of file-sharing
            service, VCSs can save different versions of files without the possibility of overwriting a file and losing it forever, or dealing with the cumbersome motions of organizing files yourself. Like Google Docs, 
            users can see progress in real time, but unlike Google Docs, if two people edit the same file, that does not mean that the original file is lost forever. This allows for the best parts of many
            contributions to be incorporated into a project.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three different types of VCSs. The first is a Local VCS. A Local VCS is simple--it is basically a local computer with a checkout area for a file, and then a version database, where 
            the different versions of the file are stored. The next VCS is the Centralized VCS. A Centralized VCS is like a Local VCS, but allows interaction between project workers. Both can access the version database. But a downfall
            to this system is that everyone's work is saved in one area. Not unlike a Local VCS, if something corrupts the area where all of that work is being stored then there is no guarantee that the worker(s) won't lose all of their hard work. The final 
            VCS is the Distributed VCS. A Distributed VCS is the most reliable because all of the computers working on files act like clones of each other--that meaning that if one server goes down, those files can be found in other places and minimal work will be lost.</div>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Works in Snapshots</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> The next concept that I found interesting about Git is that unlike what I believed version control to be, Git works in "snapshots". This means that when a file is modified with Git, it is not permanently changed forever. These versions that I have been discussing are merely like little pictures of each
            other but with small changes. That is why Git is so beneficial. If a file is changed, there may be no way to recover what has been modified. For example, if a group is working together on code and one person changes a part of it, it may turn out fine. But if something goes wrong and the code originally worked (but doesn't now), 
            those workers can't revert back to the code that worked--causing a lot of headache and unneeded stress. Git's freeze-frames take control of that situation by not allowing it to happen.</div>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes to the Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There is a lifecycle to the files you use with Git. When Git sees you modify a file, it notes the changes. Once you are done modifying the file, you stage it and then commit those changes made and the file waits to start the cycle 
            again when it is checked out. To keep track of everything that is happening with your files, Git offers many commands so that you can check the status of your files, track new files, stage modified files, ignore files, and much more. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This first step was one of the easier parts of my assignment. A Git repository has a few steps to it. You have to set up an account with GitHub. You link the GitHub account to your Cloud9 or other IDE software with an SSH key. 
            That's the easy part. Then comes moving items to the repository. This was a tedious process but it is very satisfying to finally get everything configured correctly. Git language is different than others that I have encountered, and I can only 
            minimally relate it to Unix. But once it is set up, this is a great tool for working alone or especially with others.
